# DATA PROCESSING FOR MASTER'S THESIS
# data from 2 experiments (two-choice maze) - experiment 1 had 24 subjects and experiment 2 had 12 subjects
# subjects were trained daily 3 trials per day
# data collected includes success (0 or 1 for each trial, 0 to 3 for each day), non-contingent errors (0 or 1 for each trial, 0 to 3 for each day), and position errors (no restricting parameters)
### random effects include SUCCESS, NC_errors, P_errors ###
### fixed effects include SEX and DAY ###

# first upload data for each experiment
exp1 <- read.csv("exp1.csv", header = TRUE)
exp2 <- read.csv("exp2.csv", header = TRUE)
