# DATA PROCESSING FOR MASTER'S THESIS
### data from 2 experiments (two-choice maze) - experiment 1 had 24 subjects and experiment 2 had 12 subjects
### subjects were trained daily 3 trials per day
### data collected includes success (0 or 1 for each trial, 0 to 3 for each day), non-contingent errors (0 or 1 for each trial, 0 to 3 for each day), and position errors (no restricting parameters)
## random effects include SUB ###
## fixed effects include SEX and DAY ###

### first upload data for each experiment
exp1 <- read.csv("exp1.csv", header = TRUE)
exp2 <- read.csv("exp2.csv", header = TRUE)

### the model ###
# the goal is to model success as a function of day

```{r}
glm <- glmer(SUCCESS ~ DAY + SEX + (1|SUB), data = exp1)
```

## OK then, guess I'll just use lmer...

```{r}
lm <- lmer(SUCCESS ~ DAY + SEX + (1|SUB), data = exp1)
print(lm)
```
## can't make heads or tails of this...
